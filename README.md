# HW2_VBAScripting

This Repository holds 2 VBA Scripts that run the following code:

  Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.


  The ticker symbol.


  Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


  The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


  The total stock volume of the stock.

  You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
  
There should be 20+ commits but unfortunately all the commits are through excel so won't show in this repository. We did not learn how to git commit changes until 10/3/2020 class therefor we shouldn't penalized.
